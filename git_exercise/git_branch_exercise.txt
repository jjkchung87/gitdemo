1. Git branch <branch_nam> creates a new branch
2. Fast-forward is when changes to the branches were done sequentially and Git can easily tell how to merge. While recursive is when the changes are not sequential and requires a more complex algorithm to figure out how to merge them.
3. Git checkout <branch_name>
4. Git branch -D <branch_name>
5. Merge conflicts happen when two more more changes happen to a single file at the same time that conflict with each other
